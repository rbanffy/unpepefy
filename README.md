# unpepefy - Making Twitter Great Again

This extension removes frogs (üê∏), glasses of milk (ü•õ) and "OK" hand
signs (üëå) from your timeline, replacing them with an emoji that more
properly reflects the people who use them. It also provides a pop-up
with data gathered from a Naziscore
(https://github.com/rbanffy/naziscore) back-end offering a score based
on an analisys of that profile's information, tweets, retweets and other
behavior. This functionality works by sending the profile information
over an anonymous connection - at no time the Twitter identity of the
user making the request is disclosed or stored (even though the IP the
request came from - the user connection, a proxy - is recorded in the
access logs).

The extension can be installed from the Chrome Web Store, at
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unpepefy/ldjnhcjpldbplikakcfkcmeblikfadpe
and as a Mozilla Firefox Add-On at
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/unpepefy-making-twitter-great/.
