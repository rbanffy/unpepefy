# unpepefy - Making Twitter Great Again

This extension removes frogs (🐸), glasses of milk (🥛) and "OK" hand
signs (👌) from your timeline, replacing them with an emoji that more
properly reflects the people who use them.

The plugin can be installed from the Chrome Web Store, at
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unpepefy/ldjnhcjpldbplikakcfkcmeblikfadpe
and as a Mozilla Firefox Add-On at
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/unpepefy-making-twitter-great/.
