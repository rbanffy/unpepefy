# unpepefy - Making Twitter Great Again

This extension removes frogs (🐸) from your timeline, replacing them with
an emoji that more properly reflects the people who use them.

The plugin can be installed from the Chrome Web Store, at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unpepefy/ldjnhcjpldbplikakcfkcmeblikfadpe.
